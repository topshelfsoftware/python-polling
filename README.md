# python-polling

Poll a target function for status.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.9 | 3.10 | 3.11 | 3.12 installed on system
2. Optionally, create a file named `local_pypi_dir.txt` in the project root directory (same folder as this `README`)
    - Contents of file are a single line defining the path to a local directory to be used as a local PyPI repository.

### Set Up Environment

To create the dev environment, navigate to the project root directory and run the following

```bash
make setup [PYTHON3=python3]
```

>NOTE: This command creates a virtual environment to `./.venv` and downloads all the
packages required to debug/test the source code as well as other developer tools. Specify
a minor version of Python 3 using the `PYTHON3=python3.<minor>` arg.

If the dev environment has already been setup, then the dependencies can be updated with

```bash
make update [PYTHON3=python3]
```

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are located in the `./tests` directory and are written using `pytest`.
To run all unit tests, execute the following command from the project root directory

```bash
make test
```

### Formatting and Linting

To ensure consistent style and catch potential errors, this repo formats Python code using `black` and
lints Python code using `ruff`. To format and then lint, run

```bash
make format
```

## Deployment

### Package

Build the `topshelfsoftware-polling` Python package as a wheel and copy it to the local PyPI repository

```bash
make package
```

## Versioning

This package uses Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 to describe MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH releases.

IMPORTANT‚ùó
Search the project for the existing package version and update in the following places prior to building the package and deploying the lambda layer:

- shields.io badge in this `README`
- `PKG_VER` variable in the project `Makefile`
- `version` in the poetry `pyproject.toml`
